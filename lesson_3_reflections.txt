When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
     when i want to share my project with someone else,or if i want to work from other 
     system.i can access my project on other system. also,remots can be a good way backing up
     my work.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote sotred locally ?
     you can see that state of the remote even if you're offline . it also
     allows you to do comarisions with what is on the remote.
 How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub ? what would be easier , and what would be
 harder ?
